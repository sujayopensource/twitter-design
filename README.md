System design of Twitter

1) Mainly contains 5 folders:
  a) Block-Diagram -> Contains block diagram of logical architecture
  b) DFD --> Contains flow diagrams for most flows
  c) System-Infra-Architecture --> Contains the system and infra architecture diagram
  d) RDBMSSchema --> COntains schema for tables  used in RDMBS
  e) RoughSheets -->Conytains rough work of mine that shows how these flows and diagrams evolved.They are images.
  
  2) All diagrams contain notes or text that descibe flows.If something is missing its due to lack of time.That will be explained in words :) 
  
  3) If System arch diagram is clumsy due to lack of space an dproper tooling, please refer sheet 24 of rough sheets. The rough sheet is numbered at top like one numbers pages in an exam sheet :) .
